# Capture-Video-and-Audio
Capturing video involves the acquisition and processing of sequential frames from a video source, such as a camera or pre-recorded file. In the context of machine learning, this process often incorporates computer vision techniques to analyze and interpret the visual content of each frame. The video stream is typically processed frame by frame, with each frame undergoing preprocessing steps, such as resizing or normalization. These preprocessed frames are then fed into a machine learning model for inference, where the model makes predictions or classifications based on its training. Post-processing steps, like drawing bounding boxes or adding labels, may follow the model's output. The final processed frames are displayed in real-time or saved as a new video file. This iterative process allows for the extraction of valuable information from the video stream, making it applicable in various domains, including object detection, image classification, and more. The implementation often involves libraries like OpenCV for video capture and processing
